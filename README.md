# Tenka-ichi-Budokai-Style-Elimination

This is a program I decide to make after watching REGNR8's giveaway on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU-PkmM6MGk).

This is a simple program, that simply put, loads for example, a .csv or .txt file with each participants name in a new line, and after pressing *START*, it will generate a random number, and remove that number from the list, and will do that until only one remains. REGNR8 did this manually in the video linked above, and I though I could make his life simpler.

The most important thing to me since the start, was the design of the program and how things are display, since I wanted to make it look good and still *fun* to watch. That's why, after having everything loaded (like the image below shows), if you would click on the Logo, it will hide the *Options* and *Exit* buttons, and only show a big *Start* button.

In the *Options* menu, you can define if you want the program to make the eliminations automatically (defaul checked, if unchecked, you will need to hit *Start* button every time to remove one item. The *wait time* option is, when in automatic mode, how much time between elimination the programs pauses.
